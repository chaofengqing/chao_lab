This page introduces the Chao Lab Guidelines for a PhD or Masters student. The guidelines are not applicable to post-docs or to students who are only my academic mentees but are not working with me on any projects.
 

## Ground rules

  - This is an English-only lab, including but not limited to emails, presentations, and discussions.
  - Only use emails to contact Dr. Chao.

## Lab culture

  - All members works directly with Dr. Chao. Hence, the group size will be kept relatively small so that Dr. Chao can ensure high-quality interation with each lab mate.
  - All lab mates are equal, i.e. no hierarchy within the lab.
  - Zero tolerance on bullying, abuse, or any unprofessional behavior.
  
## Kick start
To get on board, a student should:
  - Sign a service agreement (not a labor contract) with Dr. Chao, so that working hours can be compensated.
  - Join the Chao Lab working email group, so that the lab announcements can be received.
  - Join the Chao Lab OneDrive folder, so that one can access the lab resources.
  - Dr. Chao will request an account for the High Performance Computing (HPC):
    - Compulsory for PhD students.
    - Optional for Master students unless with strong computational background.

## What to expect
  - Weekly lab meetings:
    - During the semester: in-person.
    - During the winter & summer breaks: in-person and/or via zoom.
    - No meetings during the public holidays or during the weekends.
  - Presentations to the lab:
    - Twice per semester on average.
  - One-to-one meetings with Dr. Chao:
    - Once a week on average for PhD students.
    - Once every two weeks for Master students.
      - If good progress is made, one can email Dr. Chao and request to meet after one week.
  - Attending research seminars in Hong Kong in-person is encouraged.
  
## How to exit the lab

  - All the students have the right to withdraw from the lab any time.
  - Schedule a meeting/zoom call with Dr. Chao to fix a final day at the lab.
  - Email Dr. Chao with a one-month notice period before the agreed final day.
  - Relax, no hard feelings, and move on.
