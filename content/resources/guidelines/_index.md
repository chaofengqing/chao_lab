This page introduces the Chao Lab Guidelines for a PhD or Masters student. The guidelines are not applicable to post-docs.
 

## Basic rules

  - This is an English-only lab, including but not limited to emails and discussions.
  
  - Only use emails to contact Dr. Chao.

## Kick start the lab work
To get on board, a student should:
  - Sign a service agreement (not a labor contract) with Dr. Chao, so that working hours can be compensated.
  
  - Join the Chao Lab working email group, so that the lab announcements can be received.
  
  - Join the Chao Lab OneDrive folder, so that one can access the lab resources.

## How to exit the lab

  - All the students have the right to withdraw from the lab any time.
  
  - Email Dr. Chao with a one-month notice period before the agreed final day.
