This page summarizes the presentation tips based on comments for past presentations in Chao Lab.
 

##  **Delivery & Presentation Style**

### Eye Contact & Engagement

- Do not look at the slides all the time, maintain eye contact with audience
- Point to the picture/blackboard when explaining visual content
- Do not read from the script - speak naturally
- Explain plots in detail, convey messages properly

### Pacing & Clarity

- Use animation to show bullet points one by one
- Avoid too many words on slides - shorten or split content
- Don't just read through table row names - explain properly
- State one sentence to highlight motivation of comparisons

##  **Slide Content & Structure**

### Background & Definitions

- Need more background info on research with common terms explained
- Motivation should be mentioned at the beginning
- Write out full forms when first introducing acronyms
  - ASFR 15-19: define formally (Age-Specific Fertility Rate for females 15-19)
  - 45q15: define properly (probability of dying between 15-60 years old)

### Visual Improvements

- Add plots to better explain context
- Use titles that convey key messages of plots
- Increase font sizes (text, legends, labels)
- Make grey colors more visible
- Adjust dot sizes (cex) for better visibility
- Merge legends into one where possible
- Update legend titles to distinguish training/testing data

## **Technical Content & Explanations**

### Model & Methodology

- Explain logit transformation and why it's used
- Highlight each contribution clearly
- Explain sampling error meaning and known values
- Be consistent with notation (Ω_i vs ω²)
- Make indices clear (i, c, t, j)
- State clearly what's known vs what needs simulation

### Results Interpretation

- Highlight important results using red boxes in tables
- Discuss low coverage and break down among left-out observations
- Analyze systematic bias - from process model or data model?
- Explain why coverage percentages updated/results improved
- Ensure y-axis shows complete data ranges
- Explain what grey series represents (testing data)

## **Specific Terms Needed**

### Terminology & Notation

- N_female_st: clarify means "life years lived" not "number of females"
- Use "per 1000" consistently throughout
- Write out RW2 and RW1 fully
- Add space in "Wpp" to "WPP"
- Use "vs" instead of "versus"

### Visual Specifics

- South Africa example: discuss predictions for VR data vs survey data
- Expected proportion should be ≤ 2.5%
- Explain how states/countries are ordered in displays
- Point to specific locations on maps during explanation
- Explain GBD (Global Burden of Disease) reference

### Structural Improvements

- Use bullet points instead of dense paragraphs
- Some slides can be merged (e.g., P10 content into P11)
- Table of contents not always necessary
- Make overview slides clear they are overviews - details to follow
- Keep table captions concise
