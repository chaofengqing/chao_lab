This page summarizes the presentation tips based on comments for past presentations in Chao Lab.
 

## Basic rules

- Grammar and spelling checks for slides
- Rehearse at least once
- Stick within the time limit
- All contents in slides are subject to be questioned


## Delivery & Presentation Style

### Eye Contact & Engagement

- Do not look at the slides all the time, have eye contact with audience from time to time
- When a table/figure contains much info, point to the mentioned part to assist explanation
- Do not read from the script; talk naturally
- Explain plots in detail, convey messages properly

### Pacing & Clarity

- Use animation to show bullet points one by one, instead of showing all points in one go
- Avoid too many words on slides, shorten or split content
- Do not simply read through table row names, explain properly
- State one sentence to highlight motivation of comparisons


## Slide Content & Structure

### Background & Definitions

- Must have research background
- Main concepts and terms should be explained very clearly in the start
- Motivations should be highlighted at the beginning
- Write out full forms when introducing acronyms the first time
  - You may recall the full form in later part of the presentation again, in case the audiences forget about the full forms

### Visual Improvements

- Plots can be helpful in demonstrating complex idea vividly
- Frame titles can be served as the key messages of plots/tables in a slide
- Increase font sizes (text, legends, labels) in figure elements
- Adjust dot sizes for better visibility
- Merge legends into one where possible
- Ensure y-axis shows complete data ranges


## Technical Content & Explanations

### Model & Methodology

- Highlight each contribution clearly
- Notations should be consistent throughout the whole presentation
- Explain the key indices at least once, e.g.
  - $c$: country
  - $t$: year or time
- State clearly what are known values vs what are unknown parameters in the model

### Results Interpretation

- Highlight important results using red boxes in tables


## Specific Terms Needed

### Structural Improvements

- Use bullet points in short terms instead of long sentences
- Table of contents is not always necessary
  - This is especially so when you give a flash presentation
- In the overview slide, mention that they are overviews - details to follow in later slides
