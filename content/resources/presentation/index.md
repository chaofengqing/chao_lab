This page summarizes the presentation tips based on comments for past presentations in Chao Lab.

## Basic rules

1. Grammar and spelling checks for slides
2. Rehearse at least once
3. Stick to the time limit
4. All contents in slides are subject to be questioned

## 🎤 Delivery & Presentation Style

### 👀 Eye Contact & Engagement

- Do not look at the slides all the time, have eye contact with audience from time to time
- When a table/figure contains much info, point to the mentioned part to assist explanation
- Do not read from the script; talk naturally
- Explain plots in detail, convey messages properly

### ⏱️ Pacing & Clarity

- Use animation to show bullet points one by one, instead of showing all points in one go
- Avoid too many words on slides, shorten or split content
- Do not simply read through table row names, explain properly
- State one sentence to highlight motivation of comparisons

## 🧩 Slide Content & Structure


### Background & Definitions

- Must have research background  
- Main concepts and terms should be explained very clearly in the start  
- Motivations should be highlighted at the beginning  
- Write out full forms when introducing acronyms the first time  
  - You may recall the full form later in the presentation, in case the audience forgets  

### Visual Improvements

- Plots can be helpful in demonstrating complex idea vividly  
- Frame titles can serve as the key messages of plots/tables  
- Increase font sizes (text, legends, labels) in figures  
- Adjust dot sizes for better visibility  
- Merge legends where possible  
- Ensure the y-axis shows complete data ranges

## 🧑‍💻 Technical Content & Explanations

### Model & Methodology

- Highlight each contribution clearly
- Notations should be consistent throughout the whole presentation
- Explain the key indices at least once, e.g.
  - $c$: country
  - $t$: year or time
- State clearly what are known values vs what are unknown parameters in the model

### Results Interpretation

- Highlight important results using red boxes in tables

## ✅ Specific Terms Needed

### Structural Improvements

- Use bullet points in short terms instead of long sentences
- Table of contents is not always necessary
  - This is especially so when you give a flash presentation
- In the overview slide, mention that they are overviews - details to follow in later slides
