abstract: Dr. Chao's team at CUHK-Shenzhen recently published [the work](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/desa_pd_2024_tp_estimating_age_sex_specific_adult_mortality.pdf) on computing adult mortality rates in countries with high HIV prevalence using the Bayesian Hierarchical Model. This work aims to estimate the levels and trends in adult mortality for ages 15-59, i.e. the probability of dying between the ages of 15 and 59 years old, by sex from 1950 to 2023.
