title: Estimating and Projecting Disparities in Demographic Outcomes Using Bayesian Methods

event: Computational Social Science Laboratory Seminar
event_url: https://web.socsc.hku.hk/event/cssl-rhps-epdo/

location: The Univeristy of Hong Kong
address:
  street: Social Sciences Chamber 11/F, The Jockey Club Tower Centennial Campus
  city: Hong Kong

summary: The main purpose of this seminar is to introduce Dr. Fengqing Chao to the researchers in Hong Kong.
abstract: 'It is crucial to monitor demographic and global health indicators accurately to optimize resource allocation. This is especially so in developing countries where the improvement of these health indicators is most needed. However, estimating and validating these indicators are fraught with challenges, one of which is the paucity of accurate data. The Bayesian modeling approach implemented in Dr. Chaoâ€™s research provides more objective, data-driven insights into estimating demographic and global health indicators.'
