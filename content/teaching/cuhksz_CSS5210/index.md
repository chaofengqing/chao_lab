This is a postgraduate course taught by me:

* Spring, AY2024-25, CSS program, CUHKSZ.

Warning: this is a *very* challenging course. Take it only if you have an actual need of complicated statistical modeling for your research.
If you are actively looking for a job or having an internship during the course period, think twice.
