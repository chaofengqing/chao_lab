This is a postgraduate course taught by me:

* Spring, AY2024-25, CSS program, CUHKSZ.

## TL;DR
Warning: this is a *very* challenging course. Take it only if you have actual need of complicated statistical modeling for your research.
If you are actively looking for a job or having an internship during the course period, it is recommended that you drop this course as early as possible.
